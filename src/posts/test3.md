Have you seen one of the experiments where people have been re-feeding the same image to the AI agent a bunch of times?

Or Marques Brownlee's youtube videos where the video is reuploaded a 1000 times?

Over the Thanksgiving weekend I had some time on my hands and tasked Claude to write an app that guestimates macronutrients in some foods based on description + photo. There's some interesting setup in getting it right, but that's boring. It has created a great, functional app for me, but then I forced it to do a small, evil experiment for me.

I've written a quick script that looped over my codebase and ran this command.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 49;
}
```
